A basic music player build in C++ and SFML framework.

If you are in linux then run `msx_player_gui` file.
If on other os then compile all cpp files and make one outputfile which would be msx_player_gui.

**Command for compiling in g++ compiler**
```
g++ main.cpp front_end.cpp msx_player_gui.cpp tinyfiledialogs.c -o msx_player_gui
```

Enjoy!
